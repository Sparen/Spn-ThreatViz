Notes:

This project was originally meant to be made with React and Spring Java.

However, Maven *really* hated Spring and threw errors the moment a dependency was added to even the base project.

As a result, this project is now using Spark Java since I am more familiar with it.

This project is very similar to uniText Xchange except the frontend is completely different and the functionality of the backend is completely different.
